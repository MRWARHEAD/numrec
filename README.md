## Synopsis

All header files from numerical recipes. 1st Edition.

1. Shooting method
In numerical analysis, the shooting method is a method for solving a boundary value problem by reducing it to the solution of an initial value problem. Roughly speaking, we 'shoot' out trajectories in different directions until we find a trajectory that has the desired boundary value.

## Tests
